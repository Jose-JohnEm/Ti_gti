# Ti

This a new programmation language I created.
Its goal its to facilitate Calculator programmation allowing
a best computer programming experience.


# Gti

This is the compilator.
I have to created this because calculators can't understand
my language. So Gti's goal is to translate the Ti code to
calculators code. Then, we just have to copy the rendering
on the calculator.
